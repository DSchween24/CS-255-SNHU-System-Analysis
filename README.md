Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass is a student driver training business. The owner of DriverPass, Liam, hopes to take advantage of a void in the market when it comes to training 
students for a driving test at the DMV. To acheive this, The client, Liam, and his IT Officer, Ian, are working with an analyst team to create a new online system. 
The system will be available to students through the web and application, and it will support unique profiles, practice testing, scheduling, and driver notes.
A brand-new user interface will be developed, updated, secured, and backed by the cloud.

What did you do particularly well?

To me, the most significant part of analyzing this system was identifying what information or requirements should be presented to the client and what diagrams or
functionality should be presented to the dev team. I believe I seperated the information particularly well by including only what is necessary in the business
document so the client understands the overall goal. Moreover, I included more technical requirements, functional and non-functional requirements, and diagrams in
the system design document to support the development team


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise one part of my work to revise, I would update my diagrams to be more professional and use perfect notation. I could add more description in 
the diagrams as well. For example, in the sequence and activity diagrams I could have included more objects/actors working on the system, such as the DMV. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's needs through an interview process between the design team and the business owner. The owner of DriverPass explains the vision he
has for the new system and how he expects the user to interact with it. Through the interview process, The analyst team revises the owners vision into a practical
plan while meeting the expectations identified. It is important to consider the user's needs because it helps the team understand what functionaility and requirements
are necessary to include, as well as design a optimal user interface. Understanding the user's needs also helps identify the actors, objects, and functionality 
needed to design, test, and maintain the system. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach designing software by starting with a broad and general analysis of what is the goal of the software, and what is needed to acheive this goal.
I can then begin to break down the project into classes in an object model. With each class I would indentify the methods and functions needed for the 
software to operate within itself while identifying relationships along the way. Afterward, I would model how the user interacts
with the system and what back-end users are needed to modify and maintain the software by creating a sequence and/or activity diagram. With each consecutive step in the 
planning process, I would break down the software into more specific functionality.
